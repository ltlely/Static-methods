/* Create a program that divides one number by another number. These number should allow decimal values. This program will be
 * modular and use the following methods: 
 * 
 * getNumberator
 * This method will ask the user for the numerator. The numerator should be returned back to the main method. 
 * 
 * getDenominator
 * This will ask the user for the denominator. If the denominator is equal to  0, the program should print an error message
 * and ask the user to enter the denominator again. The method should continue to ask the user for the denominator as long as the
 * denominator is equal to 0. Once the user enters a number other than 0, the denominator should be returned to the main method.
 * 
 * calculateQuotient
 * This method will calculate the quotient by dividing the numerator by the denominator. The quotient should be returned to the main 
 * method.
 * 
 * print
 * This method will print the numerator, the denominator, and the quotient.
